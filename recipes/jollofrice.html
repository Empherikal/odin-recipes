    <h2>preparations</h2>
    <p>

        Chop the tomatoes, onions, and bell pepper into chunks. Place into a blender/food processor together with the ginger, garlic, and scotch bonnet pepper. Then blitz into a smooth paste.
        Place a pot over medium heat, pour in the sunflower oil, and add the blended mixture. Stir and allow to sizzle, then place a lid over it, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 20 minutes.
        After simmering for 20 minutes, remove the lid, then add the spices and seasonings (Paprika, thyme, nutmeg, bay leaf, and salt). Stir altogether.
        Also pour in the rice and vegetable or meat stock and stir together.
        Place a piece of aluminium foil into the pot, covering the entire surface of the rice (this will keep the steam in), then place a lid over the pot. Cook for 20 minutes on low heat (Stirring occasionally to cook the rice evenly and also to prevent it from burning at the bottom).
        Remove lid, bin the aluminium foil and give the rice a gentle stir, then return the lid and cook for another 5 minutes.
        Now the rice should be ready to serve. Serve hot with your favourite sides and enjoy!
